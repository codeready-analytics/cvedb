    An issue was discovered in the stashcat app through 3.9.2 for macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, and possibly other platforms. It stores the client_key, the device_id, and the public key for end-to-end encryption in cleartext, enabling an attacker (by copying or having access to the local storage database file) to login to the system from any other computer, and get unlimited access to all data in the users's context.
