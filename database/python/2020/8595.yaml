title: CVE in end
description: >
    Istio versions 1.2.10 (End of Life) and prior, 1.3 through 1.3.7, and 1.4 through 1.4.3 allows authentication bypass. The Authentication Policy exact-path matching logic can allow unauthorized access to HTTP paths even if they are configured to be only accessed after presenting a valid JWT token. For example, an attacker can add a ? or # character to a URI that would otherwise satisfy an exact-path match.
