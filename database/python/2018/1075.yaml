title: CVE in ovirt-engine-sdk-python
description: >
    ovirt-engine up to version 4.2.3 is vulnerable to an unfiltered password when choosing manual db provisioning. When engine-setup was run and one chooses to provision the database manually or connect to a remote database, the password input was logged in cleartext during the verification step. Sharing the provisioning log might inadvertently leak database passwords.
