    A CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability exists in Triconex TriStation Emulator V1.2.0, which could cause the emulator to crash when sending a specially crafted packet. The emulator is used infrequently for application logic testing. It is susceptible to an attack only while running in off-line mode. This vulnerability does not exist in Triconex hardware products and therefore has no effect on the operating safety functions in a plant.
