description: >
    The "encrypt wallet" feature in wxBitcoin and bitcoind 0.4.x before 0.4.1, and 0.5.0rc, does not properly interact with the deletion functionality of BSDDB, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain unencrypted private keys from Bitcoin wallet files by bypassing the BSDDB interface and reading entries that are marked for deletion.
