title: CVE in apache-beam
description: >
    Apache Struts 2.3.1.2 and earlier, 2.3.19-2.3.23, provides interfaces that do not properly restrict access to collections such as the session and request collections, which might allow remote attackers to modify run-time data values via a crafted parameter to an application that implements an affected interface, as demonstrated by the SessionAware, RequestAware, ApplicationAware, ServletRequestAware, ServletResponseAware, and ParameterAware interfaces. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report because of an "easy work-around in existing apps by configuring the interceptor."
