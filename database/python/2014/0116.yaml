title: CVE in apache-beam
description: >
    CookieInterceptor in Apache Struts 2.x before 2.3.20, when a wildcard cookiesName value is used, does not properly restrict access to the getClass method, which allows remote attackers to "manipulate" the ClassLoader and modify session state via a crafted request. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-0113.
