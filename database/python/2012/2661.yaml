title: CVE in record
description: >
    The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.13, 3.1.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not properly implement the passing of request data to a where method in an ActiveRecord class, which allows remote attackers to conduct certain SQL injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage unintended recursion, a related issue to CVE-2012-2695.
cvss_v2: 5.0
