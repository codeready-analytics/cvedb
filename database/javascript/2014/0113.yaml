title: CVE in to-class-name
description: >
    CookieInterceptor in Apache Struts before 2.3.20, when a wildcard cookiesName value is used, does not properly restrict access to the getClass method, which allows remote attackers to "manipulate" the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code via a crafted request. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-0094.
