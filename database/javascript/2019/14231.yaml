title: CVE in wordpress
description: >
    An issue was discovered in the Viral Quiz Maker - OnionBuzz plugin before 1.2.2 for WordPress. One could exploit the points parameter in the ob_get_results ajax nopriv handler due to there being no sanitization prior to use in a SQL query in getResultByPointsTrivia. This allows an unauthenticated/unprivileged user to perform a SQL injection attack capable of remote code execution and information disclosure.
